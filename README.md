# Arduino-Handbook
Collection of Arduino functions and libs

# Directory structure
- EN/RU/etc. - *Language directory* 
    + Libraries - *all libs*
        * LibName
    + Reference - *Just general reffference on the functions*
        * Structure/Variables/Functions
            - Structure/Variables/Functions type
            

When needed Directory shall consist of subdirectory IMG - where all the images will be stored

# Core files
Each directory shall contain **listing.md** file which contains listing of all functions of current directory with links to actual files.
