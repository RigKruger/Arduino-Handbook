# Defining Logical Levels: true and false (Boolean Constants)

There are two constants used to represent truth and falsity in the Arduino language: true, and *false*.
*false*

*false* is the easier of the two to define. *false* is defined as 0 (zero).
true

*true* is often said to be defined as 1, which is correct, but true has a wider definition. Any integer which is non-zero is true, in a Boolean sense. So -1, 2 and -200 are all defined as true, too, in a Boolean sense.

Note that the true and *false* constants are typed in lowercase unlike **HIGH**, **LOW**, **INPUT**, and **OUTPUT**.
